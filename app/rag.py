 Nutrition Guidelines

# Macronutrients
Protein: 1.6-2.2g per kg bodyweight for muscle building. Sources: chicken, fish, eggs, tofu, legumes.
Essential for: Muscle repair, satiety, metabolic health.

Carbohydrates: 3-5g per kg bodyweight for active individuals. Sources: rice, oats, sweet potato, fruits.
Essential for: Energy, workout performance, recovery.

Fats: 0.8-1.2g per kg bodyweight. Sources: avocado, nuts, olive oil, fatty fish.
Essential for: Hormone production, vitamin absorption, brain health.

# Hydration
Water intake: 30-40ml per kg bodyweight daily. More during intense training.
Electrolytes: Important for workouts longer than 60 minutes.
Pre-workout: Drink 400-600ml water 2-3 hours before exercise.
During workout: 150-250ml every 15-20 minutes for intense sessions.
Post-workout: Replace 150% of fluid lost through sweat.

# Meal Timing
Pre-workout (2-3 hours before): Balanced meal with carbs and protein.
Pre-workout (30-60 minutes before): Light snack, easily digestible carbs.
Post-workout (within 2 hours): Protein and carbs for recovery.
Daily: 4-6 smaller meals or 3 larger meals, based on preference.

 Fitness Goals and Strategies

# Weight Loss
Caloric deficit: 300-500 calories below maintenance for sustainable loss.
Expected loss: 0.5-1kg per week is healthy and sustainable.
Training: Combine cardio (3-5x/week) with strength training (3x/week).
Nutrition: High protein (2.2g/kg), moderate carbs, healthy fats.

# Muscle Building (Hypertrophy)
Caloric surplus: 200-300 calories above maintenance.
Expected gain: 0.25-0.5kg per week (minimizing fat gain).
Training: Progressive overload, 8-12 reps, 3-5 sets, 3-5x/week.
Nutrition: High protein (2.0g/kg), sufficient carbs for energy.

# Endurance Training
Focus: Gradually increase workout duration and intensity.
Training: 60-80% max heart rate for aerobic base building.
Long runs/rides: 1-2x per week at lower intensity.
Nutrition: Higher carbohydrate intake (5-7g/kg bodyweight).

# Strength Gains
Focus: Progressive overload with heavy weights (80-95% 1RM).
Training: Low reps (3-6), high sets (4-6), longer rest periods (3-5 min).
Frequency: 3-4x per week with adequate recovery.
Nutrition: Sufficient calories and protein (1.8-2.2g/kg).

 Recovery and Rest

# Sleep
Optimal duration: 7-9 hours per night for adults.
Recovery benefits: Muscle repair, hormone regulation, cognitive function.
Sleep quality: Dark room, cool temperature (18-20Â°C), consistent schedule.

# Active Recovery
Light cardio: Walking, cycling at low intensity.
Yoga or stretching: Improves flexibility and blood flow.
Frequency: 1-2 sessions per week between intense workouts.

# Rest Days
Importance: Prevents overtraining, reduces injury risk, allows adaptation.
Recommendation: At least 1-2 full rest days per week.

# Injury Prevention
Warm-up: 5-10 minutes light cardio + dynamic stretching.
Cool-down: 5-10 minutes light activity + static stretching.
Form: Proper technique is more important than weight.
Progression: Increase intensity/volume gradually (10% rule).

 Common Workout Metrics

# Heart Rate Zones
Zone 1 (50-60% max HR): Very light, recovery
Zone 2 (60-70% max HR): Light, fat burning
Zone 3 (70-80% max HR): Moderate, aerobic fitness
Zone 4 (80-90% max HR): Hard, lactate threshold
Zone 5 (90-100% max HR): Maximum, anaerobic

Max Heart Rate estimation: 220 - age

# Caloric Burn Estimates
Walking (4 km/h): 200-300 cal/hour
Running (8 km/h): 400-600 cal/hour
Cycling (20 km/h): 400-600 cal/hour
Swimming: 400-700 cal/hour
Weight training: 200-400 cal/hour
HIIT: 500-800 cal/hour
Yoga: 150-300 cal/hour

Note: Actual burn varies by weight, intensity, fitness level.

 Progress Tracking

# Key Metrics to Monitor
Body weight: Weekly weigh-ins, same time/conditions
Body composition: Body fat percentage, muscle mass
Measurements: Waist, hips, chest, arms, thighs
Performance: Strength gains, endurance improvements, workout duration
Photos: Monthly progress pictures
Energy levels: Subjective rating of daily energy
Sleep quality: Duration and restfulness
Stress levels: Impact on training and recovery

# Goal Setting Framework (SMART)
Specific: Clear, well-defined objectives
Measurable: Quantifiable metrics for progress
Achievable: Realistic based on current fitness level
Relevant: Aligned with personal health priorities
Time-bound: Set deadlines for accountability

Examples of SMART goals:
- "Lose 5kg in 10 weeks through 4x cardio/week and caloric deficit"
- "Increase bench press 1RM from 80kg to 90kg in 8 weeks"
- "Run 5km in under 25 minutes within 12 weeks"
- "Attend yoga class 2x per week for 6 weeks to improve flexibility"

 Supplements (Optional)

# Evidence-Based Supplements
Protein powder: Convenient protein source, 20-30g per serving
Creatine: 3-5g daily improves strength and power output
Caffeine: 3-6mg/kg bodyweight pre-workout for performance
Omega-3: 1-3g daily for inflammation and recovery
Vitamin D: If deficient, supports bone health and immunity
Multivitamin: Insurance against dietary gaps

Note: Whole foods should be the primary nutrition source.

 Mental Health & Fitness

# Exercise Benefits for Mental Health
Reduces anxiety and depression symptoms
Improves mood through endorphin release
Enhances cognitive function and memory
Boosts self-esteem and confidence
Promotes better sleep quality

# Mind-Body Connection
Meditation: 10-20 minutes daily reduces stress
Mindful exercise: Yoga, tai chi for mental clarity
Breathing techniques: 4-7-8 breathing for relaxation
Visualization: Mental rehearsal improves performance

# Avoiding Burnout
Listen to your body: Rest when needed
Variety: Mix different workout types
Social support: Train with friends or groups
Realistic expectations: Progress takes time
Enjoy the process: Find activities you love

 Special Populations

# Beginners
Start slowly: 2-3 workouts per week
Focus on form: Master technique before adding weight
Build base: Cardio and bodyweight exercises
Seek guidance: Consider working with a trainer initially

# Advanced Athletes
Periodization: Structured training phases (hypertrophy, strength, power, deload)
Sport-specific: Tailor training to performance goals
Recovery: Prioritize sleep, nutrition, stress management
Testing: Regular assessment of progress (1RM tests, time trials)

# Older Adults (50+)
Resistance training: Crucial for maintaining muscle mass and bone density
Balance exercises: Prevent falls and maintain functional fitness
Low-impact options: Swimming, cycling, walking
Flexibility: Daily stretching and mobility work

# Pregnancy & Postpartum
Consult healthcare provider before starting/continuing exercise
Avoid: High-impact, contact sports, exercises lying flat on back (after 1st trimester)
Focus on: Core stability, pelvic floor exercises, moderate cardio
Postpartum: Gradual return to exercise after medical clearance
